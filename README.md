<h2 style="color: #fee440;"> Lessons Learned </h1>

When I started learning C language, I was someone who had no programming experience before. Understanding basic concepts and developing algorithmic thinking was challenging in the first place. However, these difficulties encouraged me to make more effort rather than discourage me. It took time to learn concepts such as the basic syntax structure of the C language, memory management and pointers, but this process was the cornerstone of my journey of understanding programming in general.

Memory management and markers opposed as one of the most complicated issues of the C language. Careful attention was needed to prevent errors such as memory leaks and invalid markers. 

An in-depth understanding of this language has increased my ability to learn more complex languages and to grasp programming in general. The performance-oriented structure and system programming capabilities of the C language make it a language worth learning. Learning the C language has provided a solid foundation for my future programming journey.
