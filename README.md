<h2 style="colour: #fee440;"> Lessons learned </h1>

When I started learning the C language, I was someone who had no previous programming experience. Understanding the basic concepts and developing algorithmic thinking was challenging at first. However, these difficulties encouraged me to work harder rather than discouraging me. It took time to learn concepts such as the basic syntax structure of the C language, memory management and pointers, but this process was the cornerstone of my journey to understanding programming in general.

Memory management and pointers proved to be one of the most complicated aspects of the C language. Careful attention was needed to avoid errors such as memory leaks and invalid markers. 

An in-depth understanding of this language has increased my ability to learn more complex languages and to understand programming in general. The performance-oriented structure and systems programming capabilities of the C language make it a language worth learning. Learning C has given me a solid foundation for my future programming journey.
